# IoT Device Management API

A lightweight Spring Boot API to register, monitor, and control IoT devices. Designed for secure telemetry, commands, firmware updates, and alerts.

---

## Main Features

* **Device Management**

    * Register, view, update, or soft-delete devices
    * Update configurations and firmware

* **Telemetry**

    * Receive and store telemetry data
    * Query latest readings or filter by date

* **Device Control**

    * Send individual or bulk commands
    * Roll out firmware to groups

* **Groups & Alerts**

    * Organize devices into groups
    * Set up alerts with thresholds

* **Security**

    * API Key & Device Token authentication
    * Audit logs for key actions

---

## Tech Stack

* Java 17, Spring Boot 3
* Spring Data JPA (H2 in-memory DB)
* Spring Security with custom API keys
* OpenAPI/Swagger-ready (recommended)

| Method | Endpoint                  | Action                          |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/devices`                | Register a new device           |
| GET    | `/devices/{id}`           | Get device details              |
| PATCH  | `/devices/{id}/config`    | Update device config            |
| DELETE | `/devices/{id}`           | Soft-delete a device            |
| POST   | `/devices/{id}/commands`  | Send command to device          |
| POST   | `/devices/{id}/telemetry` | Ingest telemetry data           |
| POST   | `/devices/bulk-status`    | Update multiple device statuses |
| POST   | `/groups`                 | Create device group             |
| POST   | `/groups/{id}/command`    | Send command to a group         |
| POST   | `/alerts/subscribe`       | Set up an alert subscription    |

## ️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java 17
* Maven

### Build & Run

```bash
mvn clean install
java -jar target/device-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Default Database (H2)

* URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:device-db`
* User: `sa`
* Password: *(empty)*

---

## Security Details

* **API Key** → All requests → Header: `X-API-Key`
* **Device Token** → Commands/telemetry → Header: `X-Device-Token`

Example:

```http
X-API-Key: secret123
X-Device-Token: cam-token-123
```

Invalid keys or tokens return `401 Unauthorized`.

---

## H2 Console Access

1. Run the app
2. Visit: [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console)
3. Use:

    * JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:device-db`
    * User: `sa`
    * Password: *(leave empty)*

---

## Example Payloads

**Register Device**

```json
{
  "id": "cam-001",
  "name": "Front Door Camera",
  "model": "X200",
  "location": "Entrance",
  "deviceType": "CAMERA"
}
```

**Send Command**

```json
{
  "commandType": "REBOOT",
  "payload": "{\"delay\": 5}"
}
```

**Ingest Telemetry**

```json
{
  "metricType": "MOTION",
  "metricValue": 1,
  "unit": "detections"
}
```

## ️ Sample Errors

| Code | When                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------- |
| 401  | Invalid API key or device token |
| 404  | Device or resource not found    |
| 400  | Bad request / validation error  |

Example:

```json
{
  "error": "Device not found: cam-999"
}
```

## I used help from different sources as well as help from AI:

* Spring Security setup
* JPA mappings
* Authentication design
* API standardization

---


## Roadmap

* Add Swagger/OpenAPI docs
* Heartbeat monitoring
* Alert notifications (email/SMS)
* Historical data archiving
* Role-based access control
* Rate limiting
